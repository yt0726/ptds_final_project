The goal of Spotify is to find the userâ€™s favorite music list. It allows you select features you care more about and their corresponding levels. The Spotify would give two recommendation lists which are as match as possible to your selections. One of the lists is obtained by cosine similarity algorithm.     

## Installation

You can install the development version of Spotify from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yt0726/ptds_final_project")
```

## Usage   

**Run application**

To run the application, you could run this code to start-up the program. You would see the pop-up window of the application, then you could input your preference following the instructions on the first page `Introduction`. When you only run this application, you do not need to have any data. There is a data set obtained from Spotify that contains 106,943 observation (music).           

```{r,include=FALSE}
library(Spotify)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Spotify::Spotify_gui()
```

Here is the link of screencast for running APP. Please click screenshot to turn to the video:

**Run scoring function**   

Here is to simulate the output obtained by your selections. If you choose music's genre is: Funk, and you care about Danceability, Energy, Loudness, Speechiness, Liveness, and you set the corresponding levels are 9,8,5,4,7, you will get the list similar to the table below. Of course, you could use this function individually, and transmit input like the example.      

```{r scoring}
example <- Spotify_scoring(genres="Funk",
                features=c("Danceability","Energy","Loudness","Speechiness","Liveness"),
                levels = c(9,8,5,4,7))
knitr::kable(example$result)
```

**Run radar plot function**   

Besides running the application, if you have similar data set which includes a data frame like the above table, and five fixed features and their levels, you could run the radar plot individually.    

Yet, you need input the `rank` variable which indicates the song you want to plot. For example, if you want to plot the first song, you would input rank=1, if you want to plot the second, then input rank =2, and so on, and the values of their features' levels would be captured. The example below only plots one songs and compared with the selections. Check example as following:        


```{r radarplot, echo=FALSE,results='hide',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
radar_plot(example,rank = 1)
```

**Run similarity function**    

Meantime, similar to radar plot, you could also run similarity function separately. Check example as following:         

```{r}
example_2 <- Spotify_similarity(genres = "Funk",
features=c("Danceability","Energy","Loudness","Speechiness","Liveness"),
levels = c(9,8,5,4,7))

knitr::kable(example_2$result)
